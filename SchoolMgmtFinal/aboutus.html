            <p> Amar Singh Secondary School has become a symbol and a trademark across Nepal. Its history and proud
                traditions have made it a legend. Whatever people may or may not say about us in the marketplace does
                not affect us because we bear the great responsibility of preserving our honorable history and taking it
                forward. Even if someone envies or criticizes us, there is no reason for us to feel inferior, as we have
                ample evidence to inspire us. The challenge of preserving our dignity constantly motivates us to make
                beautiful efforts, and because we run on the twin tracks of challenges and inspiration, our quality will
                never diminish.

                For any individual or institution, earning a name is challenging, but once the name is earned,
                continuous effort is required to protect that reputation. Therefore, as we make no compromises in
                providing quality education, we humbly request all parents to entrust their children to the school, as
                always. We are ready and eager to welcome all students who have passed the SEE exams with warm
                congratulations and motivation to achieve their beautiful dreams.

                In life and the world, nothing exists that is entirely flawless or devoid of defects, except nature
                itself, which is endowed with all virtues. Despite human efforts, various limitations of abilities
                naturally give rise to critical gaps, which are also part of the natural process. After every
                realization, the true problem lies in failing to remain steadfast in action without surrendering to
                challenges. However, this is not the case with our teachers and staff.

                Despite acknowledging all limitations, our entire teaching community and staff continually work to
                overcome weaknesses. They remain dedicated to the welfare of the nation's pillars, the beloved
                successors of the people, and the purpose-driven, goal-oriented students, ensuring steady progress for
                their benefit.

        <div class="parts-of-school">
            <p><b><em>LABORATORY:</em></b> The laboratory is the very essence of a school. At Amar Singh, in addition to
                other branches, the science branch also has four laboratories: Physics, Chemistry, Zoology, and Botany.

                These laboratories are spacious, well-equipped, technology-enabled, and well-organized. With the
                assistance
                of experienced lab technicians who have been working for years, students are allowed to use the
                laboratory
                during their free time, outside the routine schedule, if they show interest in gaining additional
                knowledge.

                In the laboratories, students are divided into cooperative groups, and the teachers' explanatory
                demonstrations are highly effective.
            </p> <br><br>
            <p><b><em>COMPUTER LABORATORY:</em></b> In line with the demands of modern times, we have separate computer
                labs for every level in every stream. There is also a dedicated arrangement for the computer group in
                the science stream. With highly branded and advanced modern technology-equipped computers, students can
                practice on them at any time as per their course requirements. For classes 11 and 12, the computer lab
                is used for four sessions, with one group for pure and one group for mixed classes in each session.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p><b><em>LIBRARY:</em></b> At the center of the school, accessible to students of all streams and levels,
                lies a large central library. Students can borrow books from the library according to their level,
                including those prescribed by the NEB, recommended by teachers, or commonly used in the market, and take
                them home for study. They can also spend their free time studying in the library itself.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p><b><em>EXAMINATION:</em></b> In alignment with the academic calendar published by the Metropolitan Office
                and NEB, a planned calendar is published for each level, including information about exams, holidays,
                and extracurricular activities. Separate calendars are also published for each level. According to the
                calendar, the exam details are as follows:
                <br>
            <p style="padding-left: 25px;">
                a. Monthly Exams: 3-4 times <br>
                b. Trimester Exams: 2 times <br>
                c. Send-Up or Qualification Exam: 1 time <br>
                d. Annual Exam: 1 time <br>
                e. Re-Examination: 1 time <br>
                f. MCQ Tests: 2-3 times <br>
            </p>
            Through interaction with parents about exam results, we identify students' problems, seek solutions
            accordingly, provide counseling, and conduct regular training and evaluation. Based on the results,
            additional classes and individualized guidance are offered as part of remedial efforts.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p><b><em>EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES:</em></b> The school premises include a well-equipped sports ground. To
                ensure students' mental and physical development, excellent arrangements for sports activities are in
                place. The school also provides a conscious environment to nurture and showcase the inherent talents of
                students, such as leadership, artistic skills, humor, calligraphy, quizzes, olympiads, dance, public
                speaking, and acting. Opportunities for leadership or socialization are provided by allowing students to
                represent their class or the school. Free calligraphy practice sessions are also arranged for students
                in grade 12 to help them achieve excellent marks in board examinations.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p><b><em>CAFETERIA:</em></b> There are three cafeterias available within the school premises: one at the
                eastern gate, one at the northern gate, and one in the science section. They operate from 6 AM to 4 PM,
                providing both snacks and meals to students at affordable and convenient prices.
